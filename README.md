## What needs to be Done? and its difficulty
1. Save performance to file and charts to pictures									[EASY]
	- plot feature importance for tree selection									[✔]
	- plot feature importance for recursive selection								[✔]
	- plot feature importance for variance threshold								[EASY]
	- plot feature importance for information gain									[EASY]
	- plot feature importance for chi squared
	-plot DET
	-plot ROC[EASY]
	- plot anything else???															[????]
2. Make validation.py, when everything else is fixed								[EASY]
3. We do not need to work anymore on the recursive stuff. We just need to elaborately talk about it.
